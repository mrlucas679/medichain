# Default 8090, not 8080: 8080 is the IPFS gateway's port (docker-compose), and

# starts on that port (it also exports the bootstrap key below). It is NOT the
# Docker stack — that is nginx on :80, backed by PostgreSQL and shared data.
#
# The hazard is a *stale* process squatting on :8090. On 2026-08-20 a debug
# binary seven hours older than the code under test was still listening; it
# answers /health cheerfully and 404s every route added since, which reads
# exactly like a broken route registration. The preflight below refuses to run

# record ID, two identifier namespaces that are never equal — so a patient was
# refused their own records everywhere, and this suite still reported 160/160.
#
# The gap was in what was covered, not in the assertions. These cases close it:
# they exercise the endpoints with a PATIENT credential, which is the only way
# to reach the branch that was wrong.

# Run-unique identifiers. A claim is ONE PER ACCOUNT FOR LIFE, so a fixed
# wallet here passed exactly once against a persistent backend and then failed
# on every later run with ALREADY_LINKED — a section that only works on a cold
# database, which is the failure mode `check_setup` above exists to prevent.

# This used to `exit 0` unconditionally, so the suite reported "passed=89
# failed=63" and still told its caller it had succeeded. That is fine while a
# human is reading the output and wrong the moment anything automated consumes
# it: wired into CI as-is, this job would have gone green over a completely
# broken storage backend.
#
# Distinct from the "not `set -e`" decision at the top of this file. That is
# about not ABANDONING the run on the first failure — the whole point is to find
# out what else breaks. It was never a reason to misreport the final result.
