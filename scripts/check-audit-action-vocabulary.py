"""Fail the build when a handler writes an audit action the database will reject.

`access_logs.action` carries a CHECK constraint listing every permitted value.
A handler that writes a value outside it gets a constraint violation on
PostgreSQL — and nowhere else, because the in-memory repository enforces no
constraints at all. Every unit test passes; the audit row is lost in
production.

That is not hypothetical. `lab_review_approve` and `lab_review_reject` were
written by `/api/lab/review` from the day it existed and were never in the
constraint. The insert was discarded with `let _ =`, so the violation was
thrown away and the reviewer was told the result had been "approved and added
to patient records". It surfaced on 2026-08-26 only because that write was
changed into an obligation.

WHY A NEW GATE RATHER THAN THE EXISTING TEST

`test_pg_access_log_accepts_every_action_the_handlers_write` keeps a hand-copy
of the constraint's vocabulary and proves the database accepts each entry. That
proves list == constraint. The invariant that matters is

    constraint  is a superset of  { values the handlers actually write }

and a value missing from both the list and the constraint satisfies that test
perfectly while failing in production. A mirror of the thing under test cannot
detect an omission the two share. This gate reads the left-hand side from the
Rust source instead.

WHAT IT UNDERSTANDS

It scans the body of every `AccessLogEntry` / `AccessLogEntity` struct literal —
skipping the `struct` definitions themselves — and reads the action field's
right-hand side. String literals and `const` references resolve directly.

Anything else is reported as unverifiable rather than skipped. Each such
expression has to be read once and recorded in RESOLVED_EXPRESSIONS with the
values it can produce. That is deliberate friction: an audit value the gate
cannot evaluate is exactly the case that needs a person, and quietly ignoring
it would rebuild the blind spot this exists to close.

Usage:  python scripts/check-audit-action-vocabulary.py [--list]
Exit 0 = every written value is permitted by the constraint.
