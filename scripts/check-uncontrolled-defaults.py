"""Find clinical values a page asserts that nobody entered.

Two scans, because this defect has two homes.

**1. Form state (review aid, exit 0).** A field initialised in `useState({...})`
with a plausible clinical value that no control ever writes. This produced the
AMA `patientSigned: true` and the laceration `sutureType: '4-0 Nylon'` defects.

**2. Submit payloads (gate, exit 1 on anything new).** A literal in the object a
page posts to the API. This is where the worse instances live, and where this
script was blind until 2026-09-09:

  PediatricsPage   hr/rr/temp_interpretation: 'Normal'   every child's vitals
                   pain: { score: 0 }                    no pain, unasked
                   immunizations: 'Up to date'           every child
                   abuse_screening: { concerns: false }  a child-protection
                                                         screen that never ran
  TraumaPage       vital_signs: {bp:"120/80", hr:80,     textbook-normal
                                 rr:16, spo2:98}         observations on a
                                                         patient who may be shocked
  CodeBluePage     location: 'Emergency Department'      every code, anywhere
  BloodBankPage    bloodType: 'Unknown'                  while the patient
                                                         record held the type
                                                         (fixed, so it no longer
                                                         appears — it reads the
                                                         profile now)

All sixteen of those were found by hand. This script scanned past every one,
because it only ever read `useState` initialisers — and none of them are state
at all. They are literals in the object built inside the submit handler.

Replayed against the pre-fix tree, the payload scan reports all sixteen. That
replay is the only reason to believe it: a detector for a defect class you have
already cleaned up reports nothing either way.

It recurses into nested objects, which is essential — seven of the sixteen were
one level down (`vital_signs.bp`, `abuse_screening.concerns`, `pain.score`).

**Why the payload half can be a gate when the state half cannot.** A page's
form state is large and legitimately full of constants, and `PsychPage` alone
produces nine false alarms through computed-key updates. A submit payload is
small, and a literal in it is by construction the same value on every record the
page ever files. The whole tree yields thirteen, each triaged in BASELINE below
with the reason it is true of every record — mostly lifecycle states, which are
the one shape that is legitimately constant.

**What it cannot see:**

  * a value read from state that is itself wrong — the literal is the signal,
    and `formData.x` is not a literal;
  * a payload assembled by spread or by a helper function rather than written as
    one object literal;
  * `false` and `0` in *form state*, where they are a blank to be filled in. In
    a payload they are a negative assertion and are reported.

Usage:
    python scripts/check-uncontrolled-defaults.py [--list] [workspace ...]

Exit 0 = no new payload assertions. Exit 1 = a payload asserts something new,
or the baseline names something that no longer exists.
