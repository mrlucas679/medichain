/**
 * Provision the browser-test identity fixtures.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * `docs/BROWSER_FULL_APPLICATION_AUDIT_2026-08-19.md` closed as **BLOCKED**:
 * doctor and nurse workflows could not be browser-tested at all, because the
 * running image exposes only (1) a username/password form with no seeded staff
 * credentials and (2) a wallet-extension option unavailable in an isolated test
 * browser. The demo identity buttons exist in source but sit behind
 * `FEATURES.DEMO_WALLET_GENERATION`, which is development-only — and enabling
 * them in the shipped image is exactly the bypass the audit says not to add.
 *
 * The remaining honest option is the one the audit asks for: real accounts,
 * created through the product's own onboarding path, with credentials a tester
 * can type. That is what this script provisions.
 *
 * # Why it derives credentials rather than inserting rows
 *
 * It imports `client/shared/src/auth/credentials.ts` — the same module the
 * browser uses — so the fixture password is turned into an auth proof and an
 * encrypted keystore by exactly the code path a real sign-in will later verify.
 * A seed that wrote its own Argon2id row or its own envelope would drift from
 * the login it is meant to exercise, and the drift would surface as a login
 * failure nobody could explain.
 *
 * # Safety
 *
 * Synthetic data only. It refuses to run against anything but an explicitly
 * named local endpoint unless `--i-understand-this-writes-accounts` is passed,
 * and it never runs against a deployment that is not in demo mode. The
 * credentials it prints are throwaway and belong in a test profile, never in a
 * production image.
 *
 * # Running it
 *
 * It must be started from `client/`. The script lives outside that workspace
 * but imports from it, and `@polkadot/util-crypto` resolves only when the vite
 * root is the workspace that installed it:
 *
 *   cd client
 *   MEDICHAIN_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090/api  *   MEDICHAIN_ADMIN_WALLET=<existing active admin>  *   MEDICHAIN_FIXTURE_SUFFIX=.1  *   ./node_modules/.bin/vite-node ../scripts/seed-browser-test-fixtures.ts
 *
 * The manifest is written to `.browser-test/fixtures.json` at the repository
 * root regardless of where it is started from.
