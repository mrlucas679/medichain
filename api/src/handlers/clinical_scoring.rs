//! The clinical scoring catalog endpoint.
//!
//! Publishes the thresholds and constants in `crate::clinical_scoring` so a form
//! can show a live preview — a Morse total updating as the boxes are ticked, a
//! Parkland volume updating as the body chart is filled — without carrying its
//! own copy of the policy.
//!
//! Reading a number from here is not the same as being scored. Every saved
//! record's score is recomputed by the server from the inputs it received; the
//! catalog exists so the preview and the stored value come from the same
//! arithmetic instead of two implementations that drift.

use super::*;

/// Clinical scoring thresholds and constants.
///
/// The bar is a **registered caller**, not a role. The catalog describes
/// protocol and carries no patient data at all, and a patient-facing page that
/// shows a score needs the same numbers a clinician's page uses. It is not
/// public: an unauthenticated endpoint here would be a free description of how
/// the product triages.
///
/// The caller is resolved inline rather than behind a helper on purpose.
/// `scripts/check-endpoint-auth.py` reads the handler body to classify an
/// endpoint's authorization tier and cannot follow a call into a helper — it
/// scored this endpoint tier 0, "no auth decision at all", when the decision
/// was one function away. An auth decision a reader or a gate cannot see at the
/// endpoint is one nobody can audit, so the gate was right and the helper went.
