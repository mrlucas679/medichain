//! Off-chain emergency capsule and its on-chain commitment (Horizon HZ-003).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `blood_type`, `organ_donor`, and `dnr_status` used to be stored in the clear
//! in on-chain storage, as a documented exception to this project's "hashes and
//! pointers only" rule, so a paramedic could read them without a decrypt
//! round-trip. A POPIA legal review on 2026-07-28 concluded that exception does
//! not survive contact with real patient data: an immutable ledger cannot honour
//! the correction, deletion, and retention-limitation duties POPIA places on
//! health information, and a pseudonymous `AccountId` does not cure it — the
//! Information Regulator's de-identification standard turns on whether data can
//! be re-linked to a person "by a reasonably foreseeable method", and this
//! project already accepts that such correlation may happen.
//!
//! # What replaced it
//!
//! The values live in an **off-chain capsule** (this module), where they can be
//! corrected, superseded, and deleted. Only a 32-byte commitment goes on-chain,
//! via `pallet-medical-records::set_emergency_capsule_commitment`.
//!
//! The emergency-read requirement that motivated the original design is
//! untouched: the paramedic path reads this capsule from Postgres and always
//! did — it never read from chain. What the commitment adds is the ability to
//! *detect tampering* with that off-chain copy, which the previous design did
//! not provide either.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! The capsule carries provenance the old plain enums could not (who verified a
//! blood type and when; which document backs a DNR and whether it has been
//! revoked). Per the review: a recorded blood type is informational and is never
//! sufficient authorisation for transfusion on its own — compatibility testing
//! and crossmatching remain required regardless of what is stored here.
