# Drug-interaction data pipeline

**Backs:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` §4.1 / `docs/NEXT_WEEK_TODO.md` — "Import
RxNorm/DrugBank open datasets to expand drug-interaction coverage".

## What's here

`drug_interactions_builtin.json` is the single source of truth for the curated
drug-drug interaction table used by `evaluate_drug_interactions()`
(`api/src/clinical_endpoints/insurance_pharmacy/drug_checking.rs`), which backs
both `POST /api/interactions/check` and the automatic screen run inside
`create_e_prescription`. It is compiled into the binary via `include_str!`, so
the checker always has a baseline with zero configuration.

## Schema

```json
{
  "interactions": [
    { "drug_a": "warfarin", "drug_b": "aspirin", "severity": "major",
      "description": "Increased bleeding risk: ..." }
  ]
}
```

- `drug_a` / `drug_b` — lowercase, matched as a case-insensitive **substring**
  against each prescribed medication name (so `"ssri"` matches `"fluoxetine
  20mg"` only if the medication string itself contains `"ssri"` — most rows use
  a specific drug name; a few use a drug-class keyword that callers are
  expected to include, mirroring the existing table's convention).
- `severity` — one of `contraindicated` / `major` / `moderate` / (anything else
  maps to `minor`).
- `description` — clinician-facing explanation of the mechanism and risk.

## Extending the table with a real licensed dataset

RxNorm's own interaction API (the former mashup of DrugBank + Micromedex data)
was retired by the NLM in 2024 over source-data licensing, and DrugBank's own
interaction export requires a commercial or academic license — neither is a
truly "open," programmatically-downloadable dataset this pipeline can fetch on
your behalf, and fabricating placeholder interaction pairs would be actively
unsafe for a clinical system. What this pipeline gives you instead is the
**import path**, ready for when you have a licensed export:

1. Obtain a licensed drug-interaction export (DrugBank commercial/academic
   license, a UMLS-licensed RxNorm-linked interaction source, or an in-house
   pharmacy formulary export).
2. Convert it to the schema above — one row per drug pair. A short script
   (Python/`jq`/spreadsheet formula) mapping the vendor's columns to
   `drug_a`/`drug_b`/`severity`/`description` is normally all that's needed.
3. Save the converted file anywhere the API process can read, e.g.
   `/etc/medichain/drug_interactions_overlay.json`.
4. Set `DRUG_INTERACTIONS_DATA_PATH=/etc/medichain/drug_interactions_overlay.json`
   (see `.env.example`) and restart the API.

The overlay is **additive** — it supplements `drug_interactions_builtin.json`,
never replaces it. If the file is missing or fails to parse, the API logs a
warning and falls back to the built-in table only (fail-open on startup, since
losing the *overlay* must never take down drug-interaction checking — the
built-in baseline still covers the ~170 most clinically significant
interactions used in emergency/general medicine).

## Growing the built-in table without a licensed dataset

`drug_interactions_builtin.json` can also be extended directly with additional
clinically-reviewed entries (same schema) — no license needed for
independently-authored clinical content, only for redistributing a vendor's
proprietary interaction database wholesale.
# Dispensing verification policy

dispensing_policy.example.json documents the configuration boundary for
second-pharmacist verification. MediChain contains no built-in controlled-drug
mapping. A deployment must supply a reviewed JSON file and set
DISPENSING_POLICY_PATH before a matching rule can require verification.
Medication code, organization category, and medication name are exact,
case-insensitive selectors; multiple selectors on one rule must all match.
The policy version, rule id, and approved request TTL are copied into each
prescription so later decisions remain attributable to the policy in force.

The example values are deliberately non-jurisdictional and are not compliance
data.
