/**
 * Clinical scoring — the client half of `api/src/clinical_scoring.rs`.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to enforce: **a page never decides a clinical
 * value.** Six scales used to be implemented twice — once in Rust and once in
 * the TSX file that collected the inputs — and the browser's copy was the one
 * that got stored, because the handlers persisted whatever the client sent.
 * Three of the six had drifted:
 *
 * - `CardiacPage` scored TIMI's "3+ CAD risk factors" from a list containing
 *   diabetes *or* hypertension, and read "2+ anginal episodes in 24h" off a
 *   chest-pain *character* dropdown.
 * - `MCIPage` skipped START's first question — "can they walk" — with a comment
 *   saying it assumed every casualty was non-ambulatory.
 * - `FallRiskPage` posted its Morse items under keys the server did not read,
 *   so every assessment was stored as 0, which bands as low risk.
 *
 * What is here now is a **preview**, and nothing else. It exists because a nurse
 * ticking six boxes should see the total move, and a round trip per checkbox
 * would be worse than the duplication was. It reads its thresholds from
 * `GET /api/clinical/scoring/catalog`, so there is still exactly one place the
 * numbers live; without the catalog it returns `null` and the page shows a
 * dash, which is honest.
 *
 * The value that is *stored* always comes back in the create response. Show
 * that one once it arrives.
 */

import { getApiClient } from '../api/client';

/*
 * Every accessor below treats a missing *section* the same way it treats a
 * missing catalog: no value. A page that reads `catalog.timi.threshold` against
 * a catalog whose `timi` key did not arrive throws inside render, and a React
 * render that throws is a blank screen — on the burn page that is a blank
 * screen instead of a fluid order. The unit suite caught exactly this.
