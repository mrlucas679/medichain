/**
 * Request and response shapes for the endpoints that score clinically.
 *
 * These exist because the endpoint functions took `data: unknown`, which is how
 * four pages came to post payloads no handler read. `BurnPage` sent `total_bsa`
 * and `parkland_fluid` against a handler expecting `tbsa_percentage` and
 * `parkland_formula_volume`; `FallRiskPage` nested its Morse items under
 * `morse_scale` in camelCase against six flat snake_case keys; `CardiacPage`
 * sent `stemi` against an enum spelling `STEMI`; `PreOpPage` sent `II` against
 * an enum spelling `ASA2` — while the database column it feeds has always
 * accepted exactly `II`. Two of those failed loudly with a 400 and two
 * succeeded while discarding everything clinical. TypeScript could see none
 * of it.
 *
 * Every response here carries the values the **server** derived. That is the
 * point: the page displays what was stored, not what it calculated.
