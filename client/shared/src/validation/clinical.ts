/**
 * Clinical field validation.
 *
 * These are safety constraints, not form conveniences. Before this module the
 * frontend had no validation layer at all: a potassium of 640 mmol/L, a date of
 * birth in the future and a systolic below its own diastolic were all
 * submittable, and the only thing between them and the record was whatever the
 * API happened to check.
 *
 * Three rules govern what goes in here.
 *
 * **1. Ranges are physiological, not clerical.** The bounds below are set to
 * "outside this, the value is certainly a typo" — NOT to a normal reference
 * range. A potassium of 7.2 is a medical emergency and must be enterable; 640
 * is a slipped decimal point. Rejecting genuinely abnormal values would be
 * worse than accepting typos, because the abnormal ones are the ones that
 * matter. Where a bound is uncertain, it is set wide deliberately.
 *
 * **2. This is UX, not a security boundary.** Client validation exists to tell
 * a clinician about a mistake at the field, in the moment. The server must
 * validate independently, because the API is reachable without this code — see
 * `docs/OUTSTANDING_WORK.md` §3.1. Never let this be the only check.
 *
 * **3. Messages state the rule, not the failure.** "Invalid value" describes
 * the input; "Enter a value between 0 and 250" tells the user what to do. Apple
 * HIG puts it as: display the message close to the problem, avoid blame, and be
 * clear about what someone can do to fix it.
