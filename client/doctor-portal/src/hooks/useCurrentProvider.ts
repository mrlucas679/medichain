/**
 * The authenticated clinician's context, in one place.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * Screens used to reach into `useAuthStore` and re-derive whatever identity
 * they needed, so anything a screen failed to derive became a form field for
 * the clinician to fill in. The appointment scheduler asking a signed-in doctor
 * to type their own 48-character SS58 address into a "Provider ID" box was the
 * visible symptom; the cause was the absence of this module
 * (`docs/WORKFLOW_AUDIT.md`, RC-1).
 *
 * The rule this hook exists to enforce: **if the session knows it, never ask
 * for it.** Any new screen needing the current user's id, wallet, role,
 * department, specialty or licence reads it here.
 *
 * This is a convenience and correctness layer for the UI only. It carries no
 * authority: the server derives the actor for every write from the
 * authenticated session and ignores identity fields sent by the client.
