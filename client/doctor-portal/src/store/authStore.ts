       * response set `isAuthenticated: true` -- then called `acquireJwtTokens`
       * with no signer, which could never succeed. The result was a session the
       * UI treated as valid, holding no bearer token, whose every request fell
       * back to the caller-controlled `X-User-Id` header. A reload silently
       * downgraded a signed-in clinician to the weakest identity the API accepts.
       *
       * Restoring without re-authenticating needs durable session material the
       * browser can present -- a persisted refresh token, or a cookie-borne
       * session. Both are security design decisions with their own trade-offs
       * (storage exposure versus CSRF surface) and neither is implemented, so
       * this returns false rather than inventing one. Recorded for the owner in
       * the remediation ledger.
